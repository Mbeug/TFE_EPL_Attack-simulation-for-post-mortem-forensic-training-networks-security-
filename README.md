## Analysis of scientific articles
In order to organize our search and read of the documents we have added a folder **articles** divide in multiple categories : **read**, **to be read**. Some notes are taken in an Excel file called **summaries_articles.xlsx** to gather relevant data and save time by avoiding whole document reading next time.

## Things to do for meeting 30/10/2019
- Continue searching articles
- Try to get the program from the initial topic (eventually contact the authors)
- Do some experiment with Netkit and Scapy
- Think about the general structure of the program
