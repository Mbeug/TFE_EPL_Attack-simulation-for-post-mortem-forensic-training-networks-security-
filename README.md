## Analysis of scientific articles
In order to organize our search and read of the documents we have added a folder **articles** divide in multiple categories : **read**, **to be read**. Some notes are taken in an Excel file online [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pjoRHB0Wb5Mv2xuWurcemfUP_-nbiGaixM4Al2_lBsQ/edit?usp=sharing) to gather relevant data and save time by avoiding whole document reading next time.

### GNS3 API
We use the GNS3 API to create and connect dynamically virtual PCs. A first example is available with **simple_remote.py** in the **src** folder. You need to open the simpleRemote project in GNS3 then if you run the script you can create VPCs and start a capture. The capture can be found in the **capture** folder of the project.
