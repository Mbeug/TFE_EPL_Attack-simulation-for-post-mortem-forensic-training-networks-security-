## Analysis of scientific articles
In order to organize our search and read of the documents we have added a folder **articles** divide in multiple categories : **read**, **to be read**. Some notes are taken in an Excel file called **summaries_articles.xlsx** to gather relevant data and save time by avoiding whole document reading next time.
