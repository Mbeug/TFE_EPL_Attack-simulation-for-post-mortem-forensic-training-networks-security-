## Analysis of scientific articles
In order to organize our search and read of the documents we have added a folder **articles** divide in multiple categories : **read**, **to be read**. Some notes are taken in an Excel file online [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pjoRHB0Wb5Mv2xuWurcemfUP_-nbiGaixM4Al2_lBsQ/edit?usp=sharing) to gather relevant data and save time by avoiding whole document reading next time.
